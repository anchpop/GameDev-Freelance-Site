cardBody: "We're a couple of highschool kids who love computers. <br/><br/> We knew that a quality website can open new doors for a small business, and noticed that many businesses in our hometown of Owosso really needed one. Lots of businesses in Owosso are really good at what they do - they're just not in the business of making websites. <br /><br/>So we decided that we would start a company to help these business owners make a really good website, without gouging them for prices, taking too long to do it, or making them go through the hassle of handling a server."}); %>
